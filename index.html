								<span class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="me" class="meIntro" /></span>
								<p>To start it all off, my name is Daniel Nassif and I have loved working with anything technology since I was 7. I watched my dad build his first and very own PC 2 years later and from then on, the world of tech was my tunnel vision for years to come, including right now. By the way, check out my <a href="#work">work</a>.</p>
								<p>Till days to come, my passion for tech and its components never drops. I dabble in new areas in my free time and research how things are done which lasts days on end in endless loopholes of: "oh if this comes from that then how did that develop from this" and the cycle never ends.</p>
								<p>From watching people achieve my then dreams, to taking myself to them on my own. In this timeframe I built my very own PC and even built my lecturer at university his own one too (with his parts bought by him of course), made several websites with techniques I could only imagine, developed apps that drained my brain but were so worth the development, and finally made bash scripts that vary from a basic area calculator to a fully functional blackjack game.</p>
								<p>This is just an insight to me and my work here at university and why I chose the world of technology :)</p>

								<!--MRI Scan AI-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/download.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">MRI Tumor Detection AI</h1></a>
								<p>This was my dissertation project for my final year at university. I developed an AI model that was capable of classifying 4 different types of tumors within teh brain using MRI scans. Essentially it is a classifier model that has a 98.7% accuracy in its decisions.</p>
								<p>Out of the projects I have made for the entirety of my university degreem this was by the far the most time consuming and confusing one to work on, this is just because the language I chose to do this project in (MATLAB) was one that I needed to teach myself from scratch. Not only was the language outdated but it was also unlike any of the other languages we learned during our modules. With that in mind, I still found it very interesting and knowledgable to learn a language from scratch and proceed to use its application to build and train a machine learning model that can one day hopefully help doctors.</a></p>

								<!--Android App-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/year6.png" alt="" /></span>
								<a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/android-studios-Year6Dashboard-app" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 6 Dashboard Android App</h1></a>
								<p>This project was the first android project I created, it basically consists of a quiz app with adjustable questions, choices and answers, a background changer, a simple calculator that does basic arithmetics, and finally a notes app. We were required to make 10 logins that are hardcoded and only using one of them were you then able to access the main dashboard where you are greeted with the choice of application for you to use.</p>
								<p>Of the 4 applications or activitites, my favourite one that I worked on and built was the notes app. I take pride in how it made for a first android project, I managed to make it look as close to the built in notepad one has on their phone but with a twist. Since we were asked to create 10 logins that are hardcoded, I made it so that each note you create is saved to your login specifically and uniquely. Ofcourse each note is editable and deletable as they should be, they are also loaded in seperately rather than all together for optimisation and simplicity.

								<!--ClotheLine-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/clotheline.png" alt="" /></span>
								<a href="https://github.com/J0YALJ0HN/ClotheLine" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">ClotheLine Eccommerce Website</h1></a>
								<p>This project was a group effort that used our knowledge of php and docker to build an eccommerce website. We first started by creating a mindmap of our structure of build, how we were to do it, the software, the whole shebang. We also, as we built, simultaneously were writing up a report for this project and its details. We took inspiration from JD, New Look, Urban Outfitters etc. which allowed us to both perfect and tweak issues with our website.</p>
								<p>As with every group project, it has it's pros and cons. The checkout feature isn'y complete as that would require an API integration of third party apps and an actual buisness bank account being set up. The address details dont save but you can edit your own details in a designated page for it. As an admin you may edit the admins, products, categories and subcategories along with adding and removing each of them.

								<!--First Portfolio-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/firstPort.png" alt="" /></span>
								<a href="https://sokkajawea.github.io/Public-portfolio-as1/" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">My first portfolio</h1></a>
								<p>My first ever project I (I should say we as a class) was required to develop and design was a portfolio of fake projects that we made. This was for our web development module in our first year which I went into blind with no previous knowledge of doing. Making this was so fun to learn as I go and make mistakes to then solve them, my lecturer gave me advice and tips along with references I can use to make my website more formidable as a first year student.</p>
								<p>I went through 4 different layouts, fonts, grids, everything that could change was changed atleast 5 times. I settled on the current design after seeing how practical it would be for the user to navigate the website, see the important information and should they need more it is accessible. You can see the publishing on <a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/Public-portfolio-as1" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></p>

								<!--Bonus Script-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bonusScript.png" alt=""></span>
								<a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/bonus-scripting-salary-shell-script" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus Salary Script</h1></a>
								<p>This is just a basic shell script that calculates the salary of a minimum of 3 employees based on the ampunt of cars they sold individually, the tax they owe and the salary post tax.</p>
								<p>Moreover, the names, salaries and months are all stored in a file that the program makes along with a directory that it also makes should the folder not exist on the device. You can see the publishing on <a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/Public-portfolio-as1" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></p>
								<hr>
								<!--BlackJack-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/blackjack.png" alt="" /></span>
								<a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/blackjack-shell-game" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">BlackJack Shell Script</h1></a>
								<p>In this project, I created a shell script that can simulate a whole game of blackjack considering all known possibilities and outcomes. In here, you can play a full game against the program and use features like selecting whether an ace is counted as a 1 or a 10. Obviously, as with many projects, it does have some bugs and workarounds but none that are too out there or easy to spot and take advantage of.</p>
								<p>Like the bonus script and the area of a rectangle script that can be viewed further down, these were all ran, tested and written on the linux system Ubuntu. I felt it easier to work with and run using terminal on Ubuntu than on windows, for that I used Oracle's virtual box with ubuntu's iso mount disk to load it. Working with a new operating system for the first time was a thrilling experience discovering and learning how to do everything from almost scratch again, furthermore, this script went through various upgrades and tweaks considering I was looking up the rules to blackjack at every turn and block of code I wrote. You can see the publishing on <a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/blackjack-shell-game/blob/main/blackjack.sh" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></p>

								<!--Area of a rectangle-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/area.png" alt="" /></span>
								<a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/area-of-a-rectangle-shell-script" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Area of a rectangle Script</h1></a>
								<p>Of the 3 shell scripts I wrote, this was by far the easiest as it was the first ever script I went on to write. Although the struggles of first writing this went on to help greatly on writing the rest, it was relatively easy to build when compared to the other 2, all it does is take your 2 inputs and your choice of measurement, be it inches or centimeters, and outputs to you the area in your prefered unit - inches squared or meters squared</p>
								<p>There is not much you can explain when it comes to simple programs but they are the foundation created in order to make the rest of the project more practical to build.

								<!--Kwessi James-->
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ecommerce.png" alt="" /></span>
								<a href="https://github.com/sokkajawea/ecommerce-app" target="blank"><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Ecommerce Android App</h1></a>
								<p>Last but certainly not least, an eccommerce application on android. This was built with amazon partially in mind as are most eccommerce projects, where the user must log in to view the application but should they not have an account, one is easily createable for them and then passed through for them to easily log in after setting up the account. After, the landing activity is made such that an admin can access a whole other portal that allows them to add, edit and remove both categories and products along with admins themselves too!</p>
								<p>This project in my opinion had and has the most bugs and missing features, from products not showing right sometimes to users not being able to place items in the basket and further checkout. User information is editable by the very user themselves which doesnt do it temporarily but actually alters the database. This is also the first project made using an android database API (maybe you cant call it an API if its integrated but you get the gist :) ).
